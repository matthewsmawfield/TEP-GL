<h2>5. Observational Predictions: The Era of Chronometric Mapping</h2>

<p>The transition from a geometric to a dynamical-time framework shifts the observational focus from static shapes to dynamic arrival times. The "dark sector" is predicted to reveal its true nature not in deep fields, but in high-cadence time-domain surveys. Explicit, falsifiable predictions are presented, organizing them by scale: from the millisecond "jitter" of fast transients (FRBs), to the statistical bias in variable sources, to the global tension between CMB and galaxy lensing.</p>

<h3>5.1 The "Jittering" of Lensed Transients</h3>

<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Strongly lensed fast transients (FRBs, GRBs) will exhibit achromatic <em>differential</em> arrival-time residuals between images that cannot be explained by geometric time delays (Refsdal 1964) or plasma dispersion.</p>
<p>In standard GR, the time delay \(\Delta t_{geom}\) between images is fixed by the mass distribution. In TEP, there is an additional proper-time delay \(\Delta \tilde{\tau}\). Because \(\phi\) fields in halos may have substructure (or "weather"), this delay varies across the image plane. For a millisecond-duration FRB (e.g., Muñoz et al. 2016), even a tiny gradient in \(\Delta \tilde{\tau}\) will manifest as a timing anomaly in the <em>relative</em> arrival times of the images. Unlike plasma dispersion (which scales as \(\nu^{-2}\)), this differential delay is <em>achromatic</em> (frequency-independent) but scales with distance (approximately \(\propto z^{1.5}\) due to structure growth). The anomaly appears as an "Excess Delay vs Redshift" rather than a frequency-dependent sweep. This distinguishes it from "excess Dispersion Measure" (DM), allowing TEP effects to be isolated from plasma effects via multi-frequency observation.</p>

<p><strong>Target Candidates:</strong> Recent literature has identified specific anomalies suitable for this test. The repeating source <em>FRB 20190520B</em> exhibits a "Dispersion Measure Excess" (\(\sim 900\) pc cm\(^{-3}\)) relative to its redshift (Koch Ocker et al. 2022), currently attributed to extreme host density. TEP predicts this excess may partially conceal an achromatic temporal delay. Additionally, <em>FRB 20190308C</em> (Chang et al. 2024) has been identified as a lensed candidate in the CHIME catalog; any discrepancy between its mass-model time delay and observed delay would constitute direct evidence of the non-geometric temporal shear \(\Delta \tilde{\tau}\).</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Consistency Check:</strong> A preliminary analysis of high-time-resolution residuals from recent catalogs (CHIME/FRB, FAST) shows consistency with TEP-GL predictions in the "Extended Regime". The following events exhibit millisecond-scale residuals matching the predicted temporal shear envelope:</p>

The consistency suggests these anomalies may be systematic metric effects rather than random astrophysical noise.</em></p>

<h3>5.2 The Variability Scatter Relation</h3>

<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> The <em>dispersion</em> (scatter) of weak-lensing shear measurements should correlate with the variability/kinematics of the background source population.</p>

<p>As derived in Section 3, the coherent "dark matter" halo arises from the static refractive index. However, the secondary "Stochastic Shear" term depends on source proper motion \(\vec{\mu}_s\). Because \(\vec{\mu}_s\) is randomly oriented, this term adds a random vector to the shear signal. TEP predicts that if one constructs a shear map using highly variable or fast-moving sources, the shear RMS will be systematically higher than for static sources, even if the mean profile (the halo) is identical.</p>

<div class="principle">
<h4>Box 5.2: The Einstein Cross Test (Existing Data)</h4>
<p>The Einstein Cross (Q2237+0305) provides a unique opportunity to test TEP with <em>existing</em> archival data. This quadruply-imaged quasar has:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High variability:</strong> The background quasar shows significant optical variability on timescales of weeks to months.</li>
    <li><strong>Anomalous flux ratios:</strong> The observed image flux ratios deviate from smooth lens model predictions, typically attributed to microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensive monitoring:</strong> Decades of photometric data exist (OGLE, Gaia, HST).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TEP Prediction:</strong> If the flux ratio anomalies are (partially) due to temporal shear rather than stellar microlensing, they should correlate with the quasar's variability timescale. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>During periods of rapid quasar variability, flux ratio anomalies should be <em>larger</em>.</li>
    <li>During quiescent periods, anomalies should regress toward the smooth-lens prediction.</li>
    <li>Unlike stellar microlensing, which is uncorrelated with the source's intrinsic state, TEP predicts that "microlensing-like" anomalies will be coherent with the quasar's own variability phases—effectively turning "on" during violent source activity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> This test can be performed immediately using archival OGLE light curves cross-correlated with flux ratio measurements. A positive detection would constitute strong evidence for TEP using existing data, independent of future FRB observations. This is flagged as a priority archival analysis.</p>
</div>

<h3>5.3 The CMB-Galaxy Lensing Tension</h3>

<p><strong>Prediction (Extended Regime):</strong> Lensing inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) should differ systematically from lensing inferred from galaxy shear.</p>
<p>While the CMB is effectively a static backlight (zero intrinsic evolution), galaxy sources are dynamic population. Under TEP, the stochastic component of the refractive index (driven by source proper motion, see Section 5.2) introduces an additional "kinematic noise" to galaxy shear measurements. Because the CMB is static, it is immune to this effect. Consequently, TEP predicts that precision cosmology inferred from galaxy weak lensing will suffer from unmodeled systematic noise bias compared to CMB lensing, potentially explaining the observed tension in the clustering amplitude (\(S_8\)).</p>

<div class="principle">
<h4>Box 5.3: \(S_8\) Tension as Noise Bias</h4>
<p><strong>Observed Tension:</strong> Current measurements show a 2–3σ discrepancy between CMB-derived and galaxy weak-lensing-derived values of \(S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}\):</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Planck</em> CMB (2018): \(S_8 = 0.834 \pm 0.016\)</li>
    <li>DES Y3 + KiDS-1000 (2021): \(S_8 = 0.790 \pm 0.014\)</li>
    <li>Discrepancy: \(\Delta S_8 / S_8 \approx 5\%\) (Galaxy < CMB)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TEP Interpretation:</strong> Previous iterations of TEP considered secular source evolution as a driver for coherent shear offsets, but the magnitude (\(\sim 10^{-6}\)) is too small to explain the 5% tension. Instead, the tension is interpreted as a <strong>Systematic Noise Bias</strong> arising from Stochastic Shear (Box 5.2).</p>

<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Standard maximum-likelihood estimators weight data by the inverse covariance (\(C^{-1}\)). If the covariance matrix excludes the source-dependent kinematic noise term (\(\sigma^2_{\mu}\)), high-variance regions (cluster outskirts) will be statistically misinterpreted as low-signal regions, effectively down-weighting the most massive structures and suppressing the inferred \(S_8\). Standard analyses assume shear noise is dominated only by random galaxy orientations ("shape noise"), missing this kinematic component.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Source-Dependent:</strong> Correlated with galaxy type and redshift (via proper motion).</li>
    <li><strong>Unmodeled:</strong> Not present in standard covariance matrices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Unmodeled excess variance in the likelihood analysis acts as a source of systematic bias. If the stochastic noise is treated as signal or dilutes the inference, it can suppress the recovered clustering amplitude \(S_8\) in galaxy surveys. The CMB, being static, is free from this kinematic noise bias and recovers the higher (true) value.</p>
    
<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> The \(S_8\) tension is not a breakdown of \(\Lambda\)CDM growth, but a signature of the TEP "noise floor". The tension should decrease if shear likelihoods are weighted by source kinematic priors.</p>
</div>

<h3>5.4 Comparison of Predictions: TEP-GL vs. Particle Dark Matter</h3>

<p>The following table summarizes the distinguishing predictions of the two frameworks:</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>The critical discriminant is the <em>source-dependence</em> of the inferred dark component. Particle dark matter lenses all sources identically; TEP-GL predicts that the apparent "dark" signal depends on the variability timescale of the background source.</p>

<h3>5.5 Falsification Criteria</h3>

<p>TEP-GL is a falsifiable hypothesis. The following observations would exclude specific regimes or the framework entirely:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Reference Envelope Exclusion:</strong> If precision timing of strongly lensed FRBs yields achromatic residuals consistent with zero to better than 0.1 ms across diverse lens environments, the Reference Envelope parameter space is excluded.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Universal Shear Scatter:</strong> If the intrinsic scatter of weak-lensing shear measurements is identical across all source kinematic classes (after correcting for measurement noise), the stochastic temporal shear mechanism is excluded.</li>

    <li><strong>CMB-Galaxy Agreement:</strong> If future surveys (e.g., CMB-S4, Rubin/LSST) demonstrate that CMB lensing and galaxy weak-lensing mass inferences agree to better than 1% after controlling for all modeling systematics, the Extended Regime parameter space is excluded.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Chromatic Anomaly:</strong> If any timing or morphological anomaly shows wavelength dependence after correction for plasma dispersion and dust, the achromatic prediction of two-metric coupling is falsified. This would indicate conventional astrophysical systematics rather than metric effects.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Direct Detection:</strong> A confirmed detection of dark matter particles in direct-detection experiments would establish the existence of a particulate dark sector. TEP would then be relegated to a sub-dominant correction rather than a primary explanation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The framework stands or falls on empirical grounds. It does not claim immunity from observation; the claim is that the observations required to test TEP have not yet been performed with sufficient precision.</p>

<div class="principle">
<h4>Box 5.1: Quantitative Falsification Thresholds</h4>
<p>To ensure rigorous falsifiability, explicit null-result thresholds are specified for each prediction channel:</p>

    <td>10% mass precision</td>
    <td>No correlation at &gt;3σ</td>
    <td>Extended Regime</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Complete Falsification:</strong> If <em>all four</em> null-result thresholds are met simultaneously—(1) no FRB timing residuals, (2) no shear-variability correlation, (3) CMB-galaxy agreement &lt;1%, and (4) no variability-mass correlation—then TEP-GL is falsified as a framework, not merely in one regime. The theory makes no predictions distinguishable from standard CDM under these conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Tests (1) and (4) are achievable within 5–10 years (CHIME, DSA-2000, Rubin/LSST). Tests (2) and (3) require next-generation surveys (CMB-S4, Euclid) with ~10-year horizons. A definitive verdict on TEP-GL is therefore expected by ~2035.</p>

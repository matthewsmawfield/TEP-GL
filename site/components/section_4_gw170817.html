<h2>4. Reanalysis of GW170817: What is Actually Constrained?</h2>

<h3>4.1 The Measurement and the Standard Translation</h3>

<p>The simultaneous detection of gravitational waves (GW170817) and gamma rays (GRB 170817A) from a binary neutron star merger at approximately 40 Mpc (Abbott et al. 2017) represents one of the most precise measurements in astrophysics. The signals arrived within \(\Delta t_{obs} = 1.74 \pm 0.05\) seconds of each other after traveling for approximately 130 million years. This is widely cited as constraining the difference between the speed of gravity \(c_g\) and the speed of light \(c_{\gamma}\) to (e.g., Baker et al. 2017; Creminelli & Vernizzi 2017; Ezquiaga & Zumalacárregui 2017; Sakstein & Jain 2017):</p>

<div class="equation">$$\frac{|c_{\gamma}-c_g|}{c} \lesssim 10^{-15}$$</div>

<p>This standard translation assumes that any delay is due to a uniform difference in propagation speed accumulating linearly over the entire cosmological distance. This section critically re-examines this assumption and analyzes what the measurement strictly constrains in a general two-metric framework.</p>

<h3>4.2 The Common-Path Invariant: A Differential Measurement</h3>

<p>A crucial but often overlooked geometric fact is that both messengers originated from the <em>exact same coordinate</em> in distant space. They passed through the same host halo, the same intergalactic voids, and the same Milky Way halo. In the geometric optics limit, they followed the same spatial trajectory through the scalar field \(\phi(\vec{x})\).</p>

<p><strong>The Common-Mode Cancellation:</strong><br>
Because the signals originate from the same coordinate and follow a nearly identical path, they do not diverge significantly. If the metric coupling contains a conformal component \(\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}\), this factor rescales the proper time along the path for <em>both</em> species identically. Any time dilation caused by passing through "time-warped regions" of space is experienced by both messengers. If the universe is "slower" in a specific region due to a scalar potential, it is slower for both the gravitational wave and the photon.</p>

<p><strong>Implication for Conformal Coupling (\(A(\phi)\)):</strong><br>
As established in Section 2, a purely conformal transformation preserves null cones. <em>GW170817 imposes no direct constraint on the magnitude of conformal coupling.</em> The measurement confirms only that light and gravity share the same causal structure along a single path; it does not constrain the <em>rate</em> at which they traverse that path relative to other paths in the universe. The constraint applies only to the <em>difference</em> in null cone structures, not the absolute rate of time flow.</p>

<h3>4.3 The Operational Reality: Decoupling the Sectors</h3>

<p>To resolve the conflict between the GW170817 constraint and dark matter phenomenology, the two metric sectors must be explicitly distinguished. A frequent objection concerns the Shapiro delay: if TEP posits significant scalar potentials to mimic dark matter, should these not introduce measurable differential delays? It is crucial to recognize that in the TEP framework, the scalar potential is not an <em>additional</em> source of delay superimposed on a gravitational background; rather, it <em>constitutes</em> the physical origin of the Shapiro delay itself.</p>

<p>The "mass" inferred from Shapiro delay measurements corresponds, in this framework, to the depth of the conformal potential \(A(\phi)\). Since Axiom 1 establishes that photons and gravitational waves traverse the same null geodesics defined by the conformal metric, they experience an identical Shapiro delay as they propagate through these potentials. Consequently, a differential arrival-time measurement like GW170817 cancels this "bulk" common-mode delay entirely, rendering the magnitude of the conformal potential unconstrained by such tests.</p>

<div class="principle">
<p><strong>Assumption (Sector Decoupling):</strong> The \(10^{-15}\) bound on the Disformal sector (the "speed of light" vs "speed of gravity") is accepted. The TEP-GL phenomenology relies entirely on the unconstrained Conformal sector gradients (the "rate of time").</p>
</div>

<p>This decoupling makes the TEP framework robust against propagation speed constraints. Consistent with the general disformal relation (Bekenstein 1993), we emphasize that the speed of gravitational waves (\(c_g\)) constrains the causal structure (the light cone) governed by the disformal term \(B(\phi)\), while the Dark Matter phenomenology in TEP arises from the conformal factor \(A(\phi)\) (the clock rate). As long as \(c_g = c_\gamma\), the rate at which time accumulates along that path is unconstrained by arrival-time differences. GW170817 strictly constrains cone tilting, but is largely insensitive to the conformal time dilation that mimics mass.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conformal Sector:</strong> Unconstrained. Can be order unity (subject to other tests).</li>
    <li><strong>Disformal Mean (Monopole):</strong> Tightly constrained by GW170817 (\(\lesssim 10^{-15}\)).</li>
    <li><strong>Disformal Gradient (Multipole):</strong> Constrained only by the requirement that the integral of the gradient not exceed the monopole bound excessively. This permits non-trivial millisecond-scale differential structure across the image plane, sufficient for the time-domain signatures predicted in Section 5.</li>
</ul>

<p>By distinguishing between the <em>speed of transmission</em> (constrained) and the <em>rate of proper time accumulation</em> (unconstrained), the viability of TEP as a solution to the dark matter problem is established.</p>

<h3>4.4 Environmental Screening and Solar System Constraints</h3>

<p>A critical quantitative challenge to the TEP framework is the magnitude of the scalar potential required to explain cluster lensing. To generate differential delays of \(10^3\text{--}10^5\) years over cosmological distances, the conformal factor \(A(\phi)\) must have significant depth. If such potentials existed unmodified within the Solar System, they would likely violate high-precision ephemerides constraints (e.g., the Cassini parameter \(\gamma\)).</p>

<p>To reconcile the large potentials required on cluster scales with the strict constraints on local scales, a Screening Mechanism is explicitly invoked. To move beyond qualitative hypotheses, the scalar sector is defined via a Galileon-type Lagrangian known to provide Vainshtein screening:</p>

<div class="equation">$$\mathcal{L}_\phi = -\frac{1}{2}(\partial \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{\Lambda^3}(\partial \phi)^2 \square \phi + \frac{g}{M_{Pl}} \phi T$$</div>

<p>where \(\Lambda\) is the strong coupling scale and \(T\) is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In high-density environments (Solar System), the non-linear term \(\frac{1}{\Lambda^3}(\partial \phi)^2 \square \phi\) dominates, suppressing the spatial gradients of \(\phi\) and restoring General Relativity to high precision (Vainshtein screening). On cosmological scales (low density), the linear kinetic term dominates, allowing the scalar field to develop the large \(10^3\text{--}10^5\) year potential depths required for TEP phenomenology. This Lagrangian formulation moves the screening argument from "wishful thinking" to standard field theory practice, ensuring mathematical consistency with local tests.</p>

<div class="principle">
<h4>Box 4.1: The Vainshtein Radius and the Screening Hierarchy</h4>

<p>For a spherically symmetric source of mass \(M\), the Vainshtein radius marks the transition between the screened (GR-like) and unscreened (modified gravity) regimes:</p>

<div class="equation">$$r_V = \left(\frac{g M}{4\pi M_{Pl} \Lambda^3}\right)^{1/3}$$</div>

<p>where \(g\) is the matter coupling and \(\Lambda\) is the strong-coupling scale. Inside \(r_V\), the non-linear kinetic term dominates and suppresses scalar gradients; outside \(r_V\), the scalar field mediates a fifth force.</p>

<p><strong>The Goldilocks Condition:</strong> For TEP phenomenology to work, the following conditions must hold:</p>
<div class="equation">$$r_{\text{Solar System}} \ll r_V(M_\odot) \quad \text{and} \quad r_V(M_{\text{cluster}}) \lesssim r_{\text{halo}}$$</div>

<p>The first condition ensures Solar System tests (Cassini, lunar laser ranging) see pure GR. The second ensures the scalar field gradients are <em>not</em> fully suppressed at halo scales where "dark matter" effects are observed.</p>

<p><strong>Parameter Space:</strong> Taking \(\Lambda \sim 10^{-13}\) eV (comparable to the dark energy scale \(H_0\)) and \(g \sim \mathcal{O}(1)\):</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(r_V(M_\odot) \approx 10\) pc \(\approx 2 \times 10^6\) AU — Solar System (scale \(\sim 50\) AU) is deeply screened.</li>
    <li>\(r_V(M_{\text{MW}}) \approx 100\) kpc — Galactic halo (scale \(\sim 50\) kpc) lies in the transition zone.</li>
    <li>\(r_V(M_{\text{cluster}}) \approx 1\) Mpc — Cluster halo (scale \(\sim 2\) Mpc) extends beyond \(r_V\), allowing large gradients in the outskirts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Screening Cliff (Parameter Tension):</strong> The ratio of conformal coupling required at cluster scales (\(\alpha \sim 10^{-1}\)) to that permitted at Solar System scales (\(\alpha \lesssim 10^{-5}\)) spans four orders of magnitude. While Vainshtein screening can in principle provide this suppression, it requires:</p>
<div class="equation">$$\frac{\alpha_{\text{cluster}}}{\alpha_{\text{Solar}}} \sim \left(\frac{r_V}{r}\right)^{3/2} \gtrsim 10^4$$</div>

<p>This ratio represents a constraint on the Lagrangian parameters \((\Lambda, g)\), acknowledged as a necessary condition for TEP viability. This hierarchy implies a specific regime of "partial screening" for intermediate-mass systems (e.g., dwarf galaxies), where deviations from GR may be detectable even if the Solar System is deeply screened. However, a critical distinction must be made:</p>

<p><strong>Single-Parameter Origin:</strong> The 10⁴ suppression ratio is <em>not</em> achieved by tuning four separate parameters for four different scales. It emerges automatically from a <em>single</em> choice of \((\Lambda, g)\) via the Vainshtein mechanism's intrinsic scale-dependence. The suppression profile \((r_V/r)^{3/2}\) is a derived consequence of the Galileon kinetic structure, not an imposed condition. Once \(\Lambda\) and \(g\) are fixed to satisfy any one scale (e.g., Solar System bounds), the behavior at all other scales is determined—there is no additional freedom to adjust cluster-scale effects independently.</p>

<p><strong>Contrast with Multi-Parameter Tuning:</strong> This differs fundamentally from scenarios requiring independent adjustment of coupling constants at each scale. The Vainshtein radius \(r_V \propto (gM/\Lambda^3)^{1/3}\) automatically produces the hierarchy: massive systems have larger \(r_V\), placing their characteristic scales closer to or beyond the screening radius. The 10⁴ ratio follows from \((M_{\text{cluster}}/M_\odot)^{1/2} \sim 10^{7.5}\) modulated by the \((r_V/r)^{3/2}\) profile—a geometric consequence, not a coincidence.</p>

<p><strong>Remaining Constraint:</strong> The genuine constraint is that \(\Lambda \sim 10^{-13}\) eV (near the dark energy scale) and \(g \sim \mathcal{O}(1)\) must hold simultaneously. This is a single two-parameter constraint, not four independent tunings. Whether this constitutes "fine-tuning" depends on one's theoretical priors; it is comparable to the requirement that the Higgs mass be near the electroweak scale. Future work should verify that these parameter values do not conflict with fifth-force laboratory bounds (Eöt-Wash, MICROSCOPE) or astrophysical constraints on light scalars.</p>

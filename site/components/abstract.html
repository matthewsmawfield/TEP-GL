    <p>Standard gravitational lensing analysis relies on the <em>Isochrony Axiom</em>—the implicit assumption that the observed image represents a synchronous spatial snapshot of the source. For evolving sources, this approximation breaks down in the presence of conformal metric couplings, creating a "temporal composite" image. This projects temporal depth onto the spatial plane, generating a <em>Temporal Shear</em> contribution that is mathematically indistinguishable from gravitational shear—a phenomenon defined here as <em>Phantom Mass</em>. Crucially, <em>GW170817 does not constrain the conformal component</em> of this coupling; because photons and gravitational waves traverse the same path, conformal time dilation is common-mode and cancels in differential measurements. While GW170817 constrains disformal propagation speeds, it leaves the conformal "rate of time" unconstrained. Conformal gradients can reproduce specific aspects of dark matter phenomenology—particularly in the time domain—without violating strong-lens arrival time constraints. The dark sector is thus reinterpreted not as an invisible substance, but as the shadow of temporal transport.</p>
